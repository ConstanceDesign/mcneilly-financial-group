    <p className="mb-4">
      Term life insurance provides affordable, temporary protection for a specific number of years (e.g., 10, 20, or 30 years). It is an ideal choice for individuals and families looking to cover financial responsibilities during critical life stages, such as paying off a mortgage or raising children.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Understanding your insurance needs—including how long coverage is required, and how those needs may change over time—is crucial. A financial needs analysis helps determine the appropriate coverage amount and term length.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Key Considerations</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li>Ideal for debt coverage, income replacement, and education funding during working years</li>
      <li>Lower premiums compared to permanent life insurance</li>
      <li>Renewable and convertible options allow future flexibility</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Expiring Coverage:</strong> Renewing term policies can be costly. Plan ahead for your long-term needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Preferred Underwriting Confusion:</strong> Health classifications like "preferred" or "standard" can affect your premium. Work with a qualified advisor to navigate the process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p className="mb-4">
      Riders such as waiver of premium, accidental death, and child protection can enhance your policy. Be sure to explore all available options before choosing your plan.
