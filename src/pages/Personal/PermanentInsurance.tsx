      Permanent life insurance provides lifelong coverage and guarantees a tax-free death benefit to your beneficiaries. Unlike term insurance, permanent policies can also build cash value over time, making them a flexible tool for estate planning, final expenses, and legacy building.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      This type of insurance is ideal for individuals who want to ensure long-term financial protection, leave a legacy for loved ones, or offset final expenses and outstanding debts in retirement.
