          Permanent life insurance provides lifetime protection and typically includes a savings component, known as the policyâ€™s cash value. Unlike term insurance, which provides coverage for a specific period, permanent insurance remains active as long as premiums are paid.

          The most common use of permanent insurance is to cover final expenses, such as funeral costs. A typical recommended amount for final expenses is around $10,000.

        <p>
          Beyond final expenses, permanent insurance can help cover outstanding debts, provide for a surviving spouse or family, or supplement retirement income through the cash value component.

          However, at McNeilly Financial Group Inc., we often find that individuals may over-prioritize permanent insurance early in life, neglecting the importance of living benefits. These benefits, such as disability insurance, address much more probable risks than early death.

        <p>
          A common recommended strategy is to purchase term insurance while young, to allocate more budget to living benefits, and later use term-to-permanent conversion options if health declines or if permanent insurance becomes more appropriate.
