          Health insurance is a form of protection that provides financial coverage for medical expenses resulting from illness or injury. It can also cover preventative services like vaccinations, screenings, and check-ups.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are several types of health insurance policies available, each designed to meet different needs. Group health insurance is often provided by employers, while individuals and families can purchase private health insurance plans. Government programs like Medicare and Medicaid also provide coverage for eligible individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
          Choosing the right health insurance policy depends on factors such as your medical needs, budget, and whether you prefer a wider range of healthcare providers or lower out-of-pocket costs.
