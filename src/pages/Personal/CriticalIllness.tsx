    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Critical Illness Insurance</h1>
    <p className="mb-4">
      Critical illness insurance provides a tax-free lump-sum payment if you're diagnosed with a covered life-altering condition. Unlike disability insurance, the benefit is paid even if you're still able to work.
    </p>
    <p className="mb-4">
      This coverage helps you handle medical expenses, travel for treatment, supplement income, or simply focus on recovery without financial stress. There are no restrictions on how you use the benefit.
    </p>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Choose Critical Illness Coverage?</h2>

      <li>Use the money however you choose â€” no receipts required</li>
      <li>Coverage typically includes cancer, heart attack, stroke, and more</li>
      <li>Return-of-premium options may refund your payments if you remain healthy</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Additional Insights</h2>
    <p className="mb-4">
